# Motion

All objects around us are in a constant state of motion. The tree leaves outside my window rustle by *moving* against each other, the birds sitting atop the trees that host them flap their wings passionately in the evening to fly to return to their homes after a long day of searching.

All these examples, in fact nearly all activites in this Universe, involve movement, the very thing we are going to tackle scientifically today.

# What is it?

So we have an intuitive idea of what concepts like motion, speed, velocity are ("that car is faster light!"), but can we trap these seemingly abstract concepts into the dreaded prison of scientific definition? Thankfully, the work has already been done.

When an object is moving, it has a certain **speed**, which is its characteristic defined by the distance it moves in a given time. Or:

<div class="maths">
speed = (distance travelled by an object) / (time taken to do so)
</div>
