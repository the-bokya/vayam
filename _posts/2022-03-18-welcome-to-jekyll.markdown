# Introduction

सुस्वगतम्! Welcome to Vayam! We are a free (as in freedom) platform aiming to ignite the thirst for knowledge in minds of everyone.

The era of this present moment is *defined* by the internet and the HUGE (don't even try imagining how HUGE!) loads of information it brings along with it. We are no longer limited by the lack of information that all the previous generations of our race had faced.

The problem is ... there's *too much* information! So much information that our minds are being desensitised to learning new things. To be blunt we are losing the very thing that divided and defined us from the rest of the sentient fauna - curiosity.

This article could easily be turned into a rant about how Instagram, YouTube, etc, are hijacking your minds, knocking them senseless with an unfathomable amount of information, and turning them into inventories or advertisement. But I won't do that.

# The Solution

Our minds are fueled by the hunger for knowing and processing new information. We revel in knowing. We at Vayam strive to do the same. We understand that internet brings with it nearly every kind of information humankind has ever had the fortune of knowing. So, we try to leverage the awesome power of the internet and use it to our gain.

We will try to make you efficient in searching for knowledge on the internet. Beware! There's no spoonfeeding because that's what we are trying to avoid and earn knowledge on our own. So let's kickstart our first chapter!

# What is Physics ... and Why?

- Well, for starters, Physics is the study of how our Universe behaves. It poses and tries to answer questions like why does the Moon love the Earth so much that it chooses to always circle it and never leave it; [how does the *math* at our houses cool the water so obediently](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-process-responsible-for-the-cooling-of-water-in-an-earthen-pot-during-the-summer) and why the hell do we exist in the first place!
- Who better to elaborate upon this question than the great physicist Richard P. Feynman? Read [The Feynman Lectures on Physics Vol. I Ch. 2: Basic Physics](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_02.html).
